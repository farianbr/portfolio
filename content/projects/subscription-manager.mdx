A full-stack **subscription manager** built with **GraphQL, Apollo, MongoDB, React, and TailwindCSS**.  
It helps users keep track of their subscriptions, set alerts, and receive email reminders before renewals.

---

## Core Features

**1. Authentication & Authorization** 
- User signup with email verification (via SendGrid SMTP). 
- Secure password hashing with `bcrypt`. 
- Login sessions using Passport.js.

**2. Email Notifications**

- Verification email during signup.
- Subscription renewal alerts (1 day before end date).
- Background jobs scheduled using `node-cron`.

**3. Subscriptions Management**

- Create, update, delete subscriptions.
- Track provider, category, amount, payment type, and end date.
- Toggle alerts on/off for each subscription.

**4. Frontend (React + TailwindCSS)**

- Responsive, modern UI.
- Loading skeletons for smooth UX.
- Toast notifications for success/error states.
- Dashboard with subscription history and statistics.

**5. GraphQL Backend**

- Apollo Server with Express integration.
- Modular schema (`typeDefs` + `resolvers`).
- Queries: fetch users, transactions, statistics.
- Mutations: signup, login, logout, create/update/delete transaction.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**

- React (Vite), Apollo Client, React Router, TailwindCSS, React Hot Toast

**Backend:**

- Node.js + Express, Apollo Server (GraphQL), Passport.js (authentication), Bcrypt (password hashing), Nodemailer + SendGrid SMTP (emails), Node-cron (scheduled tasks)

**Database:**

- MongoDB (via Mongoose)

## Key Learnings

Here are a few concise takeaways from building Subscription Manager:

- Architecture: Clear GraphQL types + centralized auth/mail simplified development.
- Reliability: node-cron worked for small scale; use idempotent jobs and external workers when scaling.
- Data: Use embedded docs for fast reads, separate collections for analytics, and index query fields (userId, endDate).
- UX: Apollo optimistic updates, skeleton loaders, and toasts made the app feel fast and polished.
- Security & Ops: Hash passwords, validate inputs server/client-side, and keep config in env vars for predictable deployments.
