## 📌 Key Learnings
Here are a few concise takeaways from building Subscription Manager:

- Architecture: Clear GraphQL types + centralized auth/mail simplified development.
- Reliability: node-cron worked for small scale; use idempotent jobs and external workers when scaling.
- Data: Use embedded docs for fast reads, separate collections for analytics, and index query fields (userId, endDate).
- UX: Apollo optimistic updates, skeleton loaders, and toasts made the app feel fast and polished.
- Security & Ops: Hash passwords, validate inputs server/client-side, and keep config in env vars for predictable deployments.
