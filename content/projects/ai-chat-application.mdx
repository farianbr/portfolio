## 🚀 Implementation Highlights

### Real-Time Architecture

The application uses **WebSocket** connections through Socket.io to ensure instant message delivery. Messages are queued on the client-side and synchronized with the server using acknowledgment patterns.

```javascript
socket.on('message', (data) => {
  updateConversation(data);
  acknowledgeReceipt(data.id);
});
```

### Token Management

Implemented efficient token counting and management to optimize API costs while maintaining conversation quality. The system intelligently truncates older messages while preserving context.

### Responsive Design

The interface adapts seamlessly across devices - from mobile phones to desktop monitors - ensuring a consistent user experience everywhere.
