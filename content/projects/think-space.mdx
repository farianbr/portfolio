Think Space is a **full-stack real-time collaboration app** that allows users to create and share visual boards with team members. It combines Socket.IO real-time sync, PostgreSQL persistence, and a modern React + Tailwind interface built around Konva.js for canvas-based editing.

## Core Features

**1. Realtime Collaboration**
- Users can create, move, edit, and delete sticky notes on a shared board.
- All actions propagate instantly to all connected clients via Socket.IO events.
- Includes event throttling and acknowledgment handling for smoother UX.

**2. Presence Mapping**
- Tracks user cursor movements in real time.
- Cursors are mapped to Konva stage coordinates for accurate positioning.

**3. Persistent Boards & Notes**
- Each board and its notes are stored in a **PostgreSQL** database via **Prisma**.
- Users can create and delete boards dynamically.
- Membership and access handled with invite-based logic.

**4. Modular Socket Architecture**
- Dedicated namespaces for boards and notes (`boardsSocket` and `notesSocket`).
- Listeners and emitters modularized per feature for better scalability.

**5. Authentication & Access**
- JWT-based authentication flow for secure user sessions.
- `requireAuth` middleware ensures protected endpoints.
- Invite members by email (with feedback if user not found).

## Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React (Vite), Tanstack Query, Axios, TailwindCSS, Konva (for canvas rendering)

**Backend:** 
- Node.js, Express, Prisma (ORM), node-cron (Scheduled task), Zod (Validation)

**Realtime:** 
- Socket.IO with event-based updates

**Database:**
- PostgreSQL (Supabase)

## Key Learnings

Here are a few concise takeaways from building Think Space:

- Built a real-time collaborative app from scratch using event-driven architecture
- Learned Konva.js for performant canvas rendering and user interactions
- Designed a modular socket system for maintainable real-time logic
- Overcame cross-platform deployment and CORS/socket configuration challenges
- Strengthened my understanding of scalable full-stack development and distributed systems
