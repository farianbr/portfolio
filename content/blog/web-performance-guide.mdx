# Optimizing Web Performance: A Practical Guide

Web performance is crucial for user experience and SEO. Here's how to make your applications faster.

## Image Optimization

Images often account for most of the downloaded bytes on a web page. Use modern formats and lazy loading:

```typescript
import Image from 'next/image';

export function OptimizedImage() {
  return (
    <Image
      src="/hero.jpg"
      alt="Hero image"
      width={1200}
      height={600}
      loading="lazy"
      placeholder="blur"
    />
  );
}
```

## Code Splitting

Split your JavaScript bundles to load only what's needed:

```typescript
import dynamic from 'next/dynamic';

const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('./HeavyComponent'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
});
```

## Measuring Performance

Use Lighthouse and Core Web Vitals to track your progress:

- **LCP (Largest Contentful Paint)**: < 2.5s
- **FID (First Input Delay)**: < 100ms
- **CLS (Cumulative Layout Shift)**: < 0.1

## Conclusion

Small optimizations add up. Continuously monitor and improve your application's performance.
