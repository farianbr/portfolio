# Building Modern Web Applications with Next.js 14
## Server Components by Default

One of the most significant changes in Next.js 14 is that all components are Server Components by default. This means better performance and smaller bundle sizes out of the box.

```typescript
// This is a Server Component by default
export default function HomePage() {
  return <div>Hello World</div>;
}
```

## Client Components

When you need interactivity, you can opt into Client Components with the `'use client'` directive:

```typescript
'use client';

import { useState } from 'react';

export default function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Count: {count}</button>;
}
```

## Server Actions

Server Actions make it easy to perform server-side operations without creating API routes:

```typescript
'use server';

export async function createPost(formData: FormData) {
  const title = formData.get('title');
  // Save to database
  return { success: true };
}
```

## Conclusion

Next.js 14 continues to push the boundaries of what's possible with React, making it easier to build fast, user-friendly applications.
